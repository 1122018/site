Yesterday was my day off, no going in to work, so I made myself useful at home and got a lot of things done.

I continued my new morning routine: 4:35 AM alarm, work til 6:45 AM, walked with the dog til 7:45 AM, ate breakfast, got clean, and started the rest of my day by about 9 AM.

I've been toying with the idea of moving my computer from my current home "office" into an unused room on the bottom floor of our house, so yesterday I decided that was what I was going to do. Though it's not so simple as just moving my desks and computer down a flight of stairs. The room I planned to use had a few couches and lot of things we had just kind of left sitting around from when we moved in 2 years ago. There was a lot to clean and prep for turning this room into a functional office space for me to work in.

I started with clearing out a small under the stairs storage spot that we had just been saving tons of cardboard boxes in for some reason. I guess we thought we could use them for sending packages to family and the like (that never happened, the boxes just piled up as we got more). So I broke them all down, loaded them in my car along with quite a few garbage bags full of broken/useless things we were also hanging onto for some reason or another. The storage spot was now completely empty, so I started moving the unused furniture we had into it. A few big couches also moved out of the way temporarily until we find a new home for them, and the room was empty.

I also cooked some real food. No store bought sauces/oven-ready whatever/etc. I refilled my spice cupboard and tried my had at making some real "fajita" style wraps. They turned out alright, I'll definitely try to improve on my recipe in the future. Maybe I'll write about what I cook later too.

After that room was cleaned, I also got all of our Christmas decorations out, and put up all the exterior lights while my wife decorated inside. Everything is feeling very festive now.

Today I will be cleaning the walls and will do at least one coat of primer. Hopefully two.

On another topic:

**This journal.**

I still don't entirely know what my plan for these posts are. Right now I'm just using them to record what I did each day. I have been writing them in the morning and, for the past two days, talking about what I did the previous day. I think I'll just swap my writing time to the evening, and talk about the same day.

I don't intend to write as much as I have the past two days, some days it may just be a really quick record of what I did in point form. I'm not really sure what I'll do. The goal for now is just to write every day and let this morph into whatever the final format ends up being. Maybe I'll start to include my cooking and share a few recipes here and there as well.

That's enough for now. Back to cleaning the walls.
