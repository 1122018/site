Today started out pretty normal. With the exception of scrambling in the morning to fix the software issues that started yesterday, it continued fairly normally as well. Right up until it didn't. 

11:55 AM my wife texts me some cryptic question about if I sent an e-transfer out of our account. Long story short, somehow someway someone got her login information, and subsequently emptied our account by sending e-transfers to themselves. Fun.

It should be sorted out, and the money will be returned. But that's far from a full resolution. Somehow her password got exposed; phones, computers, work computers, there was a lot of devices to check for any sign of viruses/security holes. In the end, nothing really came back as suspicious. So I have to believe that either something is wrong with the banking system or they in some unlikely turn of events, just brute-forced their way into our account.

I spent the majority of today making sure our devices were secure and changing passwords, adding more authentication and backup security methods. 

Beyond that, I'm still rushing to get this software replaced. It's not going well and I have to learn to efficiently use a new CMS by next week. 

On top of all that. There is a boil water notice for the entire town. Recent rain and windstorms have apparently contaminated our water supply with unsafe levels of giardia and cryptosporidium. I find it hard to comprehend how there can be a safe level of two parasites that are known to be in water that contains contaminated feces.

Shit storms. Fun day. Getting an earlier night so that I can be ultra focused on learning this new CMS for a solid few hours in the morning with no interruptions.
