I took today pretty easy.

Same routine in the morning, worked for a few hours, went for a bit longer of a walk as well. I haven’t been doing the wim hof method but I have stuck to doing a cold shower every day since. 

We finished construction on my desk today, just doing a few coats of varathane and then moving the office stuff down there.

We ordered some pizza and played pokemon and smash tonight. Pretty fun chill night, but I ate a bunch of junk I shouldn’t have. Will just have to work hard tomorrow to make up for it. 

Thats all for now.
