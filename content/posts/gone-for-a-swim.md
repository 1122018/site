Annnd.. that's me. 

At first I wasn't planning on including any pictures of myself on here, but today is a milestone and I wanted some proof, so I decided to share that here as well for whoever eventually reads through this.

The air temperature today was a balmy 3C, but we have had some frosty mornings recently, so I'd wager the water was quite cold. 

Two days ago I decided I wanted to challenge myself to a "polar bear swim". Solo though. I had already decided to do a real polar bear swim this next year whenever one was happening, but I felt like I wanted to mix up my daily activities a bit and did this.

We drove out to prudhomme lake, which is a bit down the highway outside of town. There was a lot of fish surfacing at the time, there always is around this area. Can't seem to land a fish to save my life in this spot though so I wasn't too upset about not having my rod with me.

I stripped down to some boxer shorts and just stood, and did some deep breathing for a couple minutes before heading in. I honestly expected it to be a lot colder. I have been doing strictly cold showers every day for a couple weeks now, in addition to the wim hof breathing technique, though I haven't been doing the breathing on a daily basis. In the past few days I started adding a cold dip in the bathtub after the showers, which is what prompted me to head to the lake.

I got in, and sat down neck deep, and stayed that way breathing for about a minute, dunking my head once around 30 seconds in. After that I swam around a short bit, dunked my head again, and then got out. All in all, about 2-3 minutes in the water. After I got out the only part of me that felt seriously cold was the very tips of my fingers. They warmed up quite quickly after we were in the car. The only other thing that happened was 2 middle toes on my left foot stayed numb for about an hour after the dip. I eventually massaged them for a few minutes and after standing and walking around the numbness went away. I read that it is a response that the body has to cold, where it directs blood flow away from the extremities. Even so, I never felt too cold, I never shivered, or panicked in the water. I was able to be very calm.

I'll definitely do it again. Maybe this will be a Sunday thing.
