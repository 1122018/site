Today did not go as planned. I originally planned to get my old office packed up and extra things put away temporarily into storage, so that I could start clearing the baby's room for painting. 

Instead...

My wife had some concerns that landed us in the hospital quite abruptly for a few hours. In the end, no worries with the baby, other than that she was dehydrated today. They gave her some electrolytes and sent us on our way.

In addition to that, I tried to make a Portuguese style soup/stew and ended up botching the whole thing. Even though the recipe said it would be almost impossible to screw it up. Somehow I did. Smelled terrible. Tasted "meh". Fish was extra fishy. All in all, not good. My grandma also decided to make me a stew earlier today, that I contemplated denying, but I can't tell her no. Only problem was it is mostly potatoes, which is not exactly keto friendly. After everything else that went sideways today I decided to say "Fuck it" and just eat the soup she made. Also snacked on a couple pringles that my wife bought, and almost immediately regretted that. 

It is very hard to stay on keto when your family is not playing along.

Here are some extra photos to make up for yesterday's mishap. Also featuring a couple ravens that sounded like they were oinking.

This last pic looked a lot cooler in person. The sun was shining quite strong through the underside of the bridge.
