I went fishing today. We couldn't catch anything freshwater, so we tried off the coast, each caught 1 tiny rockfish and that was it. Quite sure our fingers nearly fell off. Still can't beat fishing. Even in sub zero temps and next to no bites.

My sister's Christmas gift finally arrived today, so one more day of holiday eating is in order I suppose. Or a few with snacking on it later. She bought us a holiday yum box. We had one last year as well. There were some awesome and maybe not so awesome snacks and treats to try.

We got things like mince pie flavored fudge, with raisins. Which was not as bad as I expected it to be. Also mustard chips. Not a fan. They tasted more like horseradish than any mustard I've tried. Other than those two everything was quite tasty. One of the best things was egg yolk flavored popcorn. It reminded me of popcorn twists that come in a giant blue bag from the grocery store. Just a much more savory version. Though more "moist"? I don't really know how to describe it!

I love to try weird shit from other places, haha.

In other news. My office is complete. For now. And so I will finally share a photograph of it on here. Pictured: Yoshi and my wife's feet.

We will eventually be moving the couches out of here, whether sold or to another room. I have a couple desks that I was using in my other office that I'd like to set up in here as alternate workstations and a desk to meet with clients at potentially.

All in all, I am super happy with how it turned out. It's a much more functional workspace for me, and right now it has a very cozy sort of feel to it.

Here is a before pic, minus all the shit that used to clutter this room:

My "goal" in the end is to have a number of workstations, as well as a thinkpad mobile workstation for myself on the other desks. Whether for myself to rotate between, or for others to work on them. I'd also like to toy a bit more with the idea of having some sort of "After-School Coding Class". I've thought about it a bunch in the past, and love the idea of getting kids involved in coding early, and there is definitely nothing else like that in town here. I just don't know the specifics of it. Especially if you are allowed to have customers inside your house for business. Will find that all out when I have a bit more time to explore it later. There is a lot I want to do with my web business.

Also, it finally decided to snow. Should make for a fun walk/run in the morning.
