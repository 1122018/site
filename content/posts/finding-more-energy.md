To make sure I couldn't accidentally fall back asleep this morning, I put my phone out of reach before laying down for the night. I was up right on my first alarm, and the extra few minutes in the morning made a big difference.

I got more done this morning than any other morning so far. At least it felt like it.

I finished, for now anyways, my new home page, and finalized all my new products, or reconfigured old ones to match new infrastructure. I also started on plans to start supporting other cities around the area.

During my walk this morning I felt extremely "energized". I'm not sure if it was the fact that I didn't let my alarm snooze at all, or if I just had an unusually deep sleep. Either way, I had a lot more energy and motivation to push myself harder during the walk and throughout the rest of my day. I walked at more or less a jogging pace and covered quite a bit more ground this morning than previous days. It also took a bit less time. Maybe the fact that it's freezing cold is making me want to move faster as well.

Since my walk ended about 10 minutes earlier than normal, I also had a little more leeway in time to get ready and make breakfast, which was nice. I made some mini pancakes and scrambled eggs.

Work was work.

My wife wanted a meatball sub for dinner, so we tried our hand at making it all from scratch. Minus the buns. That turned out surprisingly well.

I secured a new client yesterday, so I'll be starting work on their project tonight.

Not much else to report today. I'm planning on doing some more painting tomorrow. I hope to get started building the desk I have planned for my new office on the weekend. Painting has to be finished first.

That's all for now.
