2019 is here, and I am going to make the most of it.

Short post today because I am brutally tired.

Had my last holiday meal at my grandparent’s house today. Time to get back on track with eating.

I built a small riser to bring my keyboard and mouse up a few inches in order to make it usable while standing. It was usable before but not without straining my wrists quite badly.

That’s all for today.
