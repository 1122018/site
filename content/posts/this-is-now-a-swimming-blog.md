Today I went for a swim again at the pool. My "schedule" there is generally 30-40 minutes of swimming, then about 10 minutes in the sauna, step out for a quick cold shower, and end with another short stint in the sauna. I'd like to be able to spend more than 10 minutes, but I'm sure that will come with doing it more often. Not trying to force anything there.

After I finished my swim I decided that this is something that I want to do regularly. Particular since I'm having shin issues while running. I thought of replacing my morning routine with a swim for a while already. So I bought a membership, for my wife and I. She's going to join me tomorrow morning for a swim.

Not much else to say today. Working on some marketing stuff for the business lately, trying to get word out a lot more effectively.
