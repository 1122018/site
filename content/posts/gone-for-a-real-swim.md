Today I decided to expedite my plans to start going to the pool. I haven’t gone to a pool due to self esteem issues and just generally being embarrassed of my body. I’m still not happy with the way I look, I still have a bit of a gut, and a huge amount of large stretch marks. But I’m coming to terms with just accepting it. In addition to working my ass off, literally, to get in shape.

For the first time in at least 10 years I took my shirt off in public and went swimming. 

It was a fairly short swim, much more tiring than I remember. I used the hot tub for a few minutes, swam a bit more, and then ended with a few minutes in the sauna. 

I definitely will be making going to the pool a regular thing. Especially with a kid coming, I want to be sure they know how to swim well as early as possible.
