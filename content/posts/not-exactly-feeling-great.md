Today was kind of a "down in the dumps" sort of day. My stomach hasn't been feeling great since last night, and my mood and energy levels were also pretty poor. Nevertheless, I did not stray from my schedule. Although I did waste my working time this morning for the most part. I spent a bunch of time reading articles and just generally browsing the web. 

My dog has an open sore on one of her paws, I'm going to give her a break from the morning run for a few days and hope it closes up quickly. I noticed it during my lunch break when I took her for a short walk. She was limping every now and then on her back paw. I had been thinking of buying her some little boots to wear since it has been freezing cold a couple days (though, not for almost the past week), I guess I was a little late to the start on that.

I have been losing a fair bit of weight combining being active for an hour or more every day with just generally being a bit more conscious of what I'm eating. I haven't been changing my diet drastically, just saying no to extra sweets and snacks, and doing a lot more home cooking. Before I started doing all of this, I weighed 224 lbs. Quite overweight for my height. This morning the scale read 215 lbs. Nearly 10 lbs down already. My goal weight is somewhere around 170-180. I had worked down to 175 in the past, and my family was commenting that I was too skinny, even though I never did fully get rid of my belly. I'm going to try and work a lot harder this time around so that I'm building some muscle to replace the fat lost.

I'm hoping that my stomach being upset is not anything related to the boil water notice. I've been very careful not to ingest any of the water, even boiled. We have a water cooling for drinking, and I've been using that water in my cooking as well as for brushing teeth. I kind of get the feeling that the upset stomach is related to the sauce I made last night. Either that or the timing is just coincidental.

On another subject. I've been getting laughed at/about/with(not likely, I'm not laughing) by these girls that I pass by in the mornings sometimes. I don't really know what they find humorous, but every time I run past them, they steer clear (I am assuming because of the dog), and start snickering/laughing while talking loudly in another language. Perhaps it's innocent, but either way, it's not exactly "polite". It's just kind of been bothering me so I figured I'd write about it a small bit.

Not much else happened today. I went to work. Felt generally undervalued, as is usual in any kind of low level employee situation I assume. And then I went home. My parents made some stew and a pie, so we went there after work for some dinner and a bite of the pie. They were both really delicious.
