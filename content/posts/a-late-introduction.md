I decided that since this is technically a public webpage, and anyone could stumble across it, I should give a little background information on who I am.

Hi.

I am 27 years old. I am a website developer/graphic designer/fishing enthusiast/serial entrepreneur/professional procrastinator.

I run a couple mildly successful businesses. As in I am not losing money by running them.

I've been married for a few years, but have been with my wife since high school.

I have a dog. Her name is Yoshi.

She's the best.

I also have a kid on the way in April (which is a big part of the motivation behind doing this).

And lastly, I have a strong desire to change my life for the better.

I don't make much money, with mine and my wife's incomes combined, we barely scrape by. We have a lot of debt to pay off as well. Which seems to be overwhelmingly common with young people these days.

That is about it. I don't do much else. I usually try to fish when I find free time. There are a lot of freshwater rivers/streams/lakes around here with some of the best salmon fishing in BC, maybe the best (at times, the past year had very low numbers and salmon fishing was closed most of the season this year). I also fish in the ocean, though I don't own a boat or anything like that. I fish from the shore, and off piers and docks. I think I do fairly well considering. 

My most recent business venture was a small investment into some materials and equipment to start making my own fishing lures (because it is way too expensive to keep buying gear from the store that I might lose in one cast). They turned out way better than I thought I could make, and are selling quite well at all the craft fairs I've taken them too. I hope to expand my craft fair ventures in the future. There is a lot of money to be made there if you can do it right.

I've decided to share a bit more of my end goal for this website today:

After 365 days of consecutively doing this, and putting 110% into my work and businesses, I want to be able to look back and see how far I've come.

I want to be able to show my family exactly what I've accomplished.

I don't intend to stop after 1 year of doing this, that is just the mark I decided really shows that I'm committed to this. And I feel I can share it with others at that point without it just being another idea or pipe dream. So far my wife doesn't even know I am writing these posts, though I did tell her I am keeping a journal. I have asked her to keep one with me from now on, and to write down what she accomplished every day.

With that said:

Yesterday I got 1 coat of primer done on the room I am turning into my new office. It was a lot more work than I anticipated to clean the walls and prep for painting. I also spilled a bunch of paint and wasted a bunch of time cleaning that up.

I made an awesome beef stew last night as well.

I also did some reworking of my main business website, in preparation for actively trying to sell my web services locally. I have partners in my business and, until recently, I've relied on them almost exclusively to help/take care of the actual selling part of my business. This hasn't really been working at all, so I am restructuring my own role and day to day to accommodate for this.

Today I got up late. I closed my eyes for half a second after my alarm went off and next thing I knew it was 5:30 AM. 

I got up in a rush and got as much as I could done before 7 AM. I went for my walk, which is slowly turning into a jog. 

I then made a little egg wrap for my wife and I. She is going to be getting up early as well (Though not as early as I am. She thinks it's crazy), so we should be able to actually eat a half decent breakfast together every morning now.

After that I headed to work, which went well for the most part.

I brought left over stew and some homemade bread over to my parents for dinner tonight. They thought it was delicious, so that's a plus.

And finally, I did a bit more work on my website and then sat down to write this post.

I'm about to go for a short run and then pass out for the night.

I guess I will be writing a lot more than I thought.
