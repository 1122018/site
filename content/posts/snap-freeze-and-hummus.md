The roads and sidewalks were frozen solid this morning and for a lot of the afternoon. My wife has been joining me on most of the walks lately, but today was just too slippery. We tried to go twice, but on one hill started just sliding down when my feet weren't even moving. We eventually drove down to a park and just did a loop there. About 50% of the normal walk distance.

Heading over to my parents place for New Years Eve tomorrow. Just hanging out, no party or anything. We are going to do some appetizers, so I tried my hand at making some hummus from scratch. It ended up like this:

Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, easy garlic for my parents. Tastes pretty great too. I've never been one to eat a lot of hummus but I may have to make this a little more often now.

Going to make some tortilla chips and bring some veggies as well for dipping. My wife is making a buffalo chicken dip, and a big bowl of punch.

Planning on playing some board games and some video games. Should be a fun night.
