Eventually it won't be pitch black in the morning and these images will actually show some more detail.

Today I decided to give the Wim Hof Method a try. I tried it first last evening. This morning I decided to change my routine a bit and see if the method made any difference in my day. 

I'd read about Wim Hof years ago for the first time, and have always been interested in giving his method a go. I spent a fair bit of time researching it yesterday evening and then again this morning before I gave it a real try. I didn't expect too much right off the bat, and I don't even know if I'm doing it properly. This was my morning schedule today:

4:35 AM - Alarm, got up

4:45 AM - Researched a bit more on the method before committing to trying a full session.

5:05 AM - Wim Hof Method. 35 breaths, 3 times.

5:20 AM - Shower. Started off comfortably warm, not hot though. Ended with about 15 or so seconds of full cold. Did a few rotations to cover my whole body and got my head under for a few seconds. The cold shower was easily the most immediate effect that I could feel. I have had a few cold showers in the past, but I really felt immediately awake and alert.

5:45 AM - Run. I ran the entire loop today. It wasn't any easier, but I wanted to push myself to do it. My heart rate was much more "stable" than the last time I pushed myself to run the entire loop.

6:40 AM - Quick rinse in the shower again and another blast of cold for a few seconds at the very end.

Then I worked until I had to drive my wife to work at around 9 AM. I've also been making us breakfast every day. Usually some oatmeal. Sometimes with an egg. Today I made some avocado egg toast as well as the oatmeal.

I had some client meetings this morning that lasted until close to 11 AM, and then spent until about 1 PM just getting other work done. In the afternoon I prepped my office for constructing the desk. 

Around 2:30 my dad came to pick me up and we went and grabbed the wood we needed. We got more or less the entire desk built in a couple hours. We ended up being one 2x4 short, so we will finish up tomorrow. Maybe about 30 mins more of work. After it is complete I'm going to sand it down and then put a nice dark stain on it. Pictures soon.

**Food**

Tonight I made my "vegan" dish. As far I know, all the ingredients are vegan. Maybe the peanut butter has something non vegan in it, but I'm not sure. 

I made spicy tofu & noodle lettuce wraps. They looked like this:

I couldn't find extra firm tofu, so I couldn't get the crisp on it like the recipe I got the ingredients from said. But overall, the dish was super filling and really satisfying. Tasted great too.

It started with a sauce, which was basically peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, chili paste, sugar, ginger and garlic. I blended it up til smooth and it came out like this:

The main dish started with just sauteing some tofu and some bell peppers:

I then sauced it up and let it continue sauteing for a while longer. Afterwards, I took the tofu and peppers out and put in some brown rice noodles that I had been soaking for about 40 minutes. Sauced those too and then combined with the tofu and peppers. Plated it up and served with some iceberg lettuce.

I'll definitely make these again in the future. The sauce wasn't amazing when I tasted it on it's own. But with the noodles and tofu, it was definitely a winner. Plus lots of left overs for lunch tomorrow is always a good thing.
