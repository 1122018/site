That picture ended up a little blurrier than I expected. Can't help it in the dark though.

> Be the change you want to see in the world.

A phrase that's been repeated a million times, though it is meaningful. Instead of working solid today, I decided I just needed a day to relax, I decided that yesterday, but figured I'd just play it by ear still.

I've been stressing a lot over work, and some of the symptoms that caused me quite a bit of concern over the holidays either haven't gone away or have returned. It seems likely to be caused by stress, either that or I've got some terrible fatal disease creeping up on me, as google would have me believe. The thing is, I don't feel stressed. I know I'm frustrated with a number of things in my life, work mainly, but I don't _feel_ stressed_._ Maybe I am bad at recognizing what stress feels like.

Today I have got some stuff around the house done, and mostly just focused on me. I downloaded a few apps today that I'm going to try to use to start a few new routines.

Number one, meditation. I've heard a million times how good and important it is, but never really gave it a real try. Today I'm changing that. I downloaded a guided meditation app and did the first session today. I didn't feel very relaxed and was just very aware of how still I wasn't sitting. I seem to almost "shake" lightly. I was also sitting cross legged, which is not something I do terribly often. So I may just need to find a more comfortable position for the first little bit.

Number two, push ups. I've been doing walks/runs and working out my legs at least slightly. But I've paid no attention to my arms/core. So today I'm changing that too. I downloaded an 0-100 push ups guided training app. I've used apps like this in the past, and gotten fairly far in them, but, inevitably, I never actually made it to 100 push ups. Not this time. I'll get to 100 push ups and then continue with keeping it in my routine. I've always been interested in body-weight exercises so that may be where this eventually leads.

Today I am being the change I want to see in myself. Tomorrow too.
