My shins hurt. I definitely am going to try not to run for a few days. I just walked again today, but the speed I'm walking also makes my shins hurt. The amount of hills on this loop is also probably not helping, though I can't really help that.

I decided last night that I was going to fast today. My doctor mentioned it as something he did as well when losing weight. I'm only fasting for just 24 hours this time. But I think I'd like to incorporate fasting as a semi-regular occurrence in my schedule.

I haven't felt massively hungry since before lunch, and now I am feeling pretty good.

My dad came over and we finished some more work on my desk. It's looking awesome now, we did some wood burning on the top and sides, and it has a crazy look to it now. Super interesting to look at. I am going to buy some varathane and try to get a semi-gloss coating for the top. We also put some supports underneath, and just need to go buy 1 more sheet of plywood. Zip it in half lengthwise and make a shelf underneath the workbench. After that is done, I think it's complete. Going to try and get that done tomorrow. Monday I'll start moving my office down there.

I made a pretty awesome looking chow mein for dinner tonight. I'll get to try it tomorrow, haha. My wife said it was really good though. Huge amount of veggies and just a bit of tofu instead of any meat in it. Excited to give it a try tomorrow. Forgot to take any pictures of it.

That's it for today. One more cool picture. It was way cooler in person though.
