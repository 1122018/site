**Rainstorms**

For some reason this image uploaded upside down. It's not upside down on my phone or on my computer. Oh well. Do a handstand.

What's the deal with the images anyways?

Basically, it's just a small piece of proof that I got outside. Every day.

I just enjoyed how glowy the ship looked in the hard rain this morning.

**Catastrophe**

Going to be a quick post today because I have a lot of shit to get done tonight.

Morning was normal. I spent more time learning new frameworks and CMS, and then prepped for a few meetings I had this afternoon. They went well, until they didn't.

A piece of software I was relying on as a "website builder" that I was offering to clients as super low budget way to get a website online crapped out on me. Again. I have waited weeks for the developers behind the software to reply in the past, and probably should have cut ties at the first sign of trouble. Now I'm already in deep and looking like a fool to my clients because I have to jump ship from this unsupported website builder. 

Long story short I am scrambling tonight to move clients that I had prepared to start using the builder as a quick and dirty sorta-CMS into a proper CMS. Hopefully this time around I've made the right choice. I believe that I have anyways.

**Food**

We had some raw chicken to cook and I scrounged some other veggies and made up a dish for tonight. I'll call it:

**Chicken with vegetables and some spicy sauce on rice**

Ingredients: Chicken, Vegetables (Onion, Tomato, Bell Pepper), Sauce (In the order I added them, sorta: Sriracha, Chili Powder, Salt, Pepper, Cumin, Paprika, Water, Milk, Dab of Butter + Some other things I grabbed from the spice cupboard and can't remember), Rice (Long grain white, or maybe it was basmati)

Sauced up, simmering down

Complete and ready to eat. 

It was good. Could have done with a little less reducing but I forgot to push start on the rice cooker. I will definitely try and make this again in the future, and probably forget how I did it the first time and it just will never be as good as this time again. As per usual.

The end.

_That wasn't very short._
