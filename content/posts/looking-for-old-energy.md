Guess that new energy yesterday wasn't meant to last.

Today was definitely a new low on the energy levels. Maybe it was due to pushing myself harder during my hour out in the morning, or an extra walk in the afternoon and evening, but whatever the reason: I am beat.

Definitely going to be an early night.

Not much to report today other than I am still sticking with my morning schedule and getting focused work done in the morning.

Today I built a new website, did some more work on my own, and failed to find the time to do any more painting. I also did some client lead research this morning and sent a few preliminary emails. 

There was a power outage during the night, and work was affected by that. I'm also the "IT guy" there so I spent the morning fixing crashed systems and rebooting servers that went down during the long outage. 

We had some servers on a UPS, but it seems like it failed to properly send the shutdown signal and rebooting was a little rough this morning. All fixed up in the end and working properly again.

Tomorrow will be my first of many weeks completed sticking to this schedule and sticking to being more productive. 

See you then.
