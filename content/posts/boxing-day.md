Another daylight walk. 

Today was a bit of a lazy day, as Boxing Day should be I believe. We lounged around, and I got a bit of work done. 

In the afternoon we went over to my parents place and played on my dad’s new vr. They had a game called Moss where you control a little mouse walking and fighting through a forest. Definitely the best vr game I’ve played yet.

I am going to do a bit of a reset on my morning walk/run. I think I started a bit too intensely. The past few days I’ve just been walking, and I’ll do that for another day or two. Afterwards I am going to write up a loose progression schedule and follow that week by week.

Back to work tomorrow.
