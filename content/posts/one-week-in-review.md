**One Week**

It hasn't gotten any easier, and I don't enjoy getting up earlier any more than before I started this. I can say that I do enjoy the results, though. In this past week I have gotten so much more done for myself than I did in the month before. Easily. Not just with work, but with keeping my house cleaner, getting work done on moving my home office, becoming more active.

My legs don't ache like they did after the first day anymore. Usually went I start my walk or jog, about 5 minutes in, I feel a bit sore around my calves. It doesn't last long and within 10 minutes of starting I don't notice any more discomfort. I keep a fast pace when I walk, and jog only slightly faster. I've had a few mornings where I felt like I had more energy so I would run as far and long as I could. Typically about 10 minutes of solid running before I start feeling very winded. To clarify, I am quite overweight for my height. Losing that weight is all part of this plan to do this for a year or more. My goal for my mornings outside is to be able to run the entire hour with relative ease.

I have completely redesigned my own business website, rebranded/reformatted all of the services I offer online, as well as started doing marketing and sales most days. I've secured 3 new clients in the past week, with another meeting lined up after the weekend. All in all, the business is looking better and with my products/services being more defined, it is getting easier to manage as well.

I haven't really done much with my other side business making fishing lures, but I'll find or make time to start doing that again soon. Once my office is moved I'll have a lot more space to be organized with that, and should make production a lot smoother. Currently I've got every crammed onto one desk in my office. I'm planning on constructing a desk for my new office that will be almost the full wall length. I haven't done many measurements yet as I'm still painting and getting the room prepped for the other plans, but I think it will be least 4 meters long.

I am planning to do a review like this at certain intervals throughout this "journey".

The tentative plan right now is for: One Week, One Month, Three Months, Six Months, and finally One Year. It may be a little more common, it really depends on if I find enough to write about to fill the gaps between after a month of doing this.

This morning I fixed up a few last details on my own homepage, finished building a client website, and sorted out some paperwork I had been putting off for a while.

My dog had a surgery a little over a month ago, and today I noticed some blood around the surgery site. I took her back to the vet and they figure the sutures are being rejected. It's been about 40 days since the surgery and the sutures can last up to 90 days before completely dissolving. They gave me a prescription of antibiotics to fight any potential infection, because even though the actual wound is very small, it's still open, and in probably the least sterile spot on a dog. It's on her butt. She's a happy pup and it doesn't seem to bother her. Still got her out for the walk this morning with no complaints and tons of energy. 

Another unexpected thing today was a problem with a website I had set up on a domain for a local contest. The domain name they purchased ended up being a very very obscure search term for something a little more on the NSFW side of things. Well, a lot more. It was porn. It was the equivalent of someone buying a therapy website and deciding on "therapist.com" only to find out there was pages and pages and pages on google for "the rapist". With the domain name and contest name being brand new, there wasn't much to fall back on with the search results. I spent the afternoon today setting up links and social media and google profiles in order to attempt to get some actual relevant search results in the next few days or weeks. We will see how that goes.

In other news:

**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate**

It's been a while since I really got any game time in. I stopped gaming "hardcore" about 3 or 4 months ago. Tonight we ordered a pizza and got a solid 2 or 3 hours into smash. It's incredibly fun, but Nintendo really disappointed with their online service. Looking at other player's thoughts, this doesn't seem to be much of a surprise to most people. The matches I tried online were incredibly laggy. We tried later to play with my sister in-law only to find out that you can't local co-op vs friends online. Even though you can local co-op in random matchmaking online. Not sure how that makes sense. I am seriously hoping that this is a mistake and we will soon be able to play in a group online with friends. If anything I'd think the local co-op online would support vs friends first, and true online vs random players second. 

All in all, the gameplay is fun, and Smash is something I've been missing for a very long time. Definitely going to be putting a lot of hours into this game over the coming months.

I think that's about it for today. Back with another review in 3 weeks, and tomorrow for more "shit I got done".
