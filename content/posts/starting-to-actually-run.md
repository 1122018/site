Today I actually ran on my walk. At least half of the loop. Probably closer to 75%, but I'll be conservative.

When I first started this walk, I wanted to try and just run it. But I hadn't been doing any exercise before and I have gotten shin splints in the past when I just started running out of the blue. 8 days in I figured it was time to try and run most of it.

I started running with a different mindset than normal, and it made it a lot easier to keep going. Whenever I ran in the past, and in the past 7 days when I tried to run a little bit, I always told myself, "Ok, just get to that stop sign and then you are good." Excuses to stop running, more or less. Today I told myself that I'm just not going to stop running. When my legs start to burn, or I start to get out of breath, I'll just slow down the run. 

But I will not stop.

I easily ran the first couple kilometers until I got to a park where I let Yoshi off leash for a couple minutes to do her business. That was the killer. After stopping it was extremely hard to keep up the same momentum again. If I hadn't stopped I think I could have run a lot more at once. After she was finished in the park, I ran again another kilometer or so, but it was significantly harder than the first, and I had to stop for a second again because she felt the need to pee on a sign post suddenly. That combined with some killer hills had me stopping a few more times. The last 1-1.5 kms before home was mostly start and stop running.

Either way, I ran, and I was pleased with the progress.

Before the run, I worked on some marketing and did some various maintenance for my clients and myself. 

I tried my hand at making some diner hash browns this morning. I don't think I got enough moisture out of the potato. They were good, but not quite right. Will have to try that again in the future.

After work I got a coat of primer done on all the walls in my new office. One more coat on the 2 walls that were really dark before should do it for primer. I'll have to go buy a bucket of paint tomorrow if it's dry. Excited to be making progress there.

Not much else to report for today. I started wearing my fitbit that I got a couple years ago again. I figured if I am doing this I should be tracking things like my heart rate. That way in a year, I can do a real comparison on my fitness. Currently, my resting heart rate is 66 bpm.

I also got a bit more time in on smash, it is frustratingly difficult sometimes in the "World of Light" mode.

Back tomorrow.
