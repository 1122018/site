Tonight was a staff Christmas party for my work. It was a pretty good time. Had some good food and made off with some sweet shades from the gift exchange. They were some “As seen on tv” polarized glasses. Makes me think of the YouTube channel crazy fission hacker.

This morning I had “eggs rancheros”. I have no idea if that’s the real name for a dish like this. My dad loaded me up with ingredients after stopping by his house yesterday while we were making Christmas rounds dropping off cookies my wife baked. The breakfast looked like this:

Beef, beans, avocado, onion, eggs, cilantro, tortillas, mole sauce. It was pretty amazing. Quite a bit better than the plain oatmeal I’ve been enjoying daily.

My walk today was just that, a walk. My shin was killing me a little bit so I tried to take it easy. But it’s getting harder to do that. I “power walked” the hell out of my loop and probably hurt my shins just as much as if I had run the whole way. If they get much worse I may have to swap my morning run for another less leg-intensive activity for a week or so. Not something I really want to do.

1 more day of work work until I get can focus hard around the holidays on business work.

I am going to make 2019 my bitch.
