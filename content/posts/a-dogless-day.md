I let the dog have a day off today. Her paw was already looking better this morning, but not quite healed, so I left her home. The run was a bit lonely without a dog. I used the opportunity to run a bit faster and push a little harder. I ended up running the majority of the way at a good pace, but stopped before the end because my shin really started to hurt. I didn't want to be off my morning routine for a week or more just because of a shin splint. After I got back home, I got the dog and took her for a light walk around the block. 

Work was busy today, and went by really quickly, except for the last hour. That was painfully slow. 3 days left until a "vacation". In quotations because it's an unpaid vacation over the holidays. I'm going to use the days off I have to put as much effort as I can into getting my own business fully functioning and recovered from the software mishap previously.

I tried to cook another rice noodle type dish tonight, but didn't really do well. I just sort of free styled, and ended up making a pretty poor tasting sauce that was just spicy more than anything else. It was still edible though. No pictures to share.

I got an email from my cell phone provider today with a summary of our monthly bill. Which I kind of just gawked at how much we were paying (a lot). I contacted the company and asked if there was any better plan we could move to. Lots of cheaper plans were offered on their website. While spending about an hour getting slow responses, I contacted another company and ended up switching right then and there to a plan that was 50% of my current costs for the exact same plan. Can't really beat that. Saving over $1000 a year on phone bills now, compared to our old plan.
