Meh.

Wasn't the greatest day today. My mood was just generally kind of "blah". Still, I stuck to my routine.

I took it easy on the walk this morning, my legs were fairly sore. My left knee was a little uncomfortable, so I guess I shouldn't have pushed hard on those hills. Oh well, sign me up for a knee replacement when I'm 60.

I decided the other day that I was unhappy with my new website. I got it to a point that I think I'm happy with this morning. Happy with it for now anyways, I'm sure I'll change my mind again in the not so distant future. There are a few little things that I still need to fix and touch up, but for the most part it is in a good place now.

I had the day off from work, and instead of focusing 100% on my business, I took the time to get the painting done in my new office. All the walls are looking pristine white now. The only thing left to do is add my accent colours and then I can start building my new desk. I'll try to get the colours painted tomorrow evening after work. Or at least the painting areas taped off.  I'm going to be doing some diagonal stripes of paint in my logos colours. I'm not entirely sure yet how I'll make sure they are completely straight. I'll figure it out somehow though.

Other than that I spent the day just getting menial things done for the business. Ran around town doing some errands, bank, post office, etc.

That's all for today.
