My camera did something weird when I took this picture. It may have been a tiny little drop of water, it was very very lightly snowing at the time. Thought it looked kind of neat.

Today my wife made dinner. She made a quinoa mushroom risotto style meal, and I did a watermelon salad to go with it. Overall, a fairly healthy meal, and not crazy heavy on the carbs. We could do better on that, but I'm not looking to make anything difficult in transitioning to this intermittent fasting schedule. So as long as we stick to that, I'm good with it. I am trying to stick to 6-7 hours eating window, and my wife, at least while pregnant, is more like 11-12. Don't want to do anything too drastic for her at the moment. Though I think a feeding window of that size should be pretty easy and not cause any major dietary changes other than cutting out late late night snacking, which can't be a bad thing.

Here's the food:

I will be seriously trying to get into and maintain ketosis at some point in the near future.

In other news, I'm getting new shoes. 

My running form is fairly poor. I have watched a fair amount of videos and read some articles on proper form, and understand the basics/idea behind what you need to change, though my form is still not great. I get pain in my arch and shin splints. So far, exclusively on my left leg. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but I know that form makes more of a difference over shoes. My shoes are very classic "running" shoes. They are some form of nike, and have a really big padded heel, which makes it a lot easier to over extend and heel strike while I walk/run.

I've ordered some vivo barefoot shoes to give them a try. They have a 100-day money back guarantee, so I'll at least give it a shot for that long. They were fairly expensive and I wasn't really wanting to spend any more money on myself for a long time, but my foot/calf pain is really bothersome and I need to put a lot of effort into changing my running form to stop that from happening. I'm hoping that these shoes will help with that change.
