Today is start of working on getting a new routine started.

I am still up at 4:35 AM. From them until about 6 AM, I work and try to be as productive as possible. Around 6 AM my wife is getting up, and we take the dog for a 15-20 minute walk around the neighborhood. 6:30 AM the pool opens during the weekday, we will try to be there shortly after. Swim and sauna until 7:30-7:45 AM. Home before 8 AM. After work, eat dinner quickly and then take the dog out for another walk. Hopefully everything done by 7 - 7:30 PM.

On the weekends the pool is open a little later in the morning, so I think I will use those mornings to still do some running, and just use the weekday pool days to recoup from that until my legs and calves are stronger. With the pool membership, I also have access to the fitness center. I plan to incorporate that into my schedule somewhere as well.

Today I finalized some new marketing stuff for my business. Should hopefully get that out public in about week and start seeing some growth shortly after.
