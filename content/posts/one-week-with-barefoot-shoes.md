I have worn nothing but these shoes for one week. Tomorrow I plan to go for a short walk in my old runners and see how they feel in comparison. I’ll also try that again at later intervals. 

My feet are still not super comfortable by any means, but walks and runs are not nearly as “painful” as they were initially. I don’t notice every little tiny rock or bump. When I do step on a bigger rock, it only really hampers my step if it was directly on my heel. 

I do enjoy the shoes, but I still have some pain in my shins and had 1 day of arch pain. I haven’t been running often again yet because I’m trying to clear this shin splint completely before I really get started with it.

In other news I bought some swim trunks and will be getting over my self-consciousness and taking a trip to the pool this next week. If I like it, I plan to try to replace running with swimming for a while. Maybe forever. I really don’t remember if I find swimming actually enjoyable. It’s been about 10 or 11 years since I went into a pool.
