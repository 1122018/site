When I walked up to this spot, I didn't expect the photo to be so cool looking. I'll definitely have to invest in a better camera in the future and revisit some of these spots at the right time to get some really great shots.

And so, after 1 day with the barefoot shoes. I definitely pushed myself a bit too hard and ran longer than I probably should have on the first try. 

Running is by far easier than walking in these shoes though. I had a couple new spots of pain, but I'll learn how to correct my form further to stop this. I was a bit surprised that walking hurt more than running, although the run is what actually hurt my feet I believe. I chalk it up to the fact that I've been at least conscious of my running form for at least a few weeks and did my best to correct it every day that I ran in my standard runners. So I think I just had a bit of a head start on running vs walking. 

I don't think they will blister, but the pads of my feet are definitely sore, and if I push myself the same tomorrow and following, they would almost surely become a big blister. From what I read about this sort of pain online, as well as just about barefoot shoes in general, is that it's likely due to too much horizontal movement on the ground. Too much friction. So my goal, while also just generally improving my form in other ways will also be to put a large focus on minimizing the time my feet are touching the ground. More or less. More specifically, being conscious of my feet dragging, sliding, or otherwise just unnecessarily "putting on the brakes". 

Day 2 of 100 with the barefoot shoe: Don't hate them. Don't love them.

In addition to not waking up at the right times, I also slacked on just my general activity level and eating as well. Not that I binged or ate a lot, I just ate more than I should have given my level of activity while sick. The food I ate was a little more rich than I think my stomach was necessarily ready for as well. 

We ordered a chili from a new business in town called Cook-A-Roux, it was pretty amazing. It was made with sweet potato instead of any meat and came with a small cornbread loaf. Very delicious all around. We also had a quiche from them a few days before, it was also very very good. I hope that they do well in town and stick around for a long while.
