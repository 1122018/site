Barefoot shoes are really cold when the ground is frozen. Some extra insoles did come with the shoes, so I may throw those in and see if it makes a difference. When the ground is frozen, in about 10 minutes of walking/running my feet/toes start to get really cold. It hasn't been so much of a problem that I've turned around because of it, particularly while actually running. It's when I'm walking to work that it is really cold. Not as much movement, so I suppose I'm generating a lot less heat on my own. Work is 10-15 minutes away depending on how fast I walk, by the time I got to the office today my toes were little ice cubes.

Assuming I don't go on a crazy binge in the next few days, I am on track to hit a fairly major weight milestone. One I've hit twice in the past and then rebounded above it just as far as I was before both times. This time will be different. 

The last time that I lost weight seriously, I didn't do enough strength training and I think that it hurt my maintenance in the end. I kind of plateaued with a bit of a belly still, even though I was well within a normal weight for my height. If I had been a bit more serious about training or running, I think that would have made the difference in keeping me on the goal of being fit. 

As I lose more weight, I am going to up the intensity of my exercise. My current goal with running is first to be able to do my normal loop at a running pace everyday, then proceed to adding more distance a little at a time. With the ultimate goal being to run out the highway to Butze Rapids trail, do the trail, and run back. The trail is between 4 and 5 km if I remember right, and the way out to it is probably about the same. The trail has a fairly big elevation change throughout which makes it quite a bit more challenging to run. All in all the run should end up being more or less 13.5km. I want to get run done before 6 months of doing this. I don't think that is unreasonable. With the current rate of my weight loss, I'll be at my target weight in less than 6 months, or at least close to it. With that, my exercise should have hopefully increased to the point that I am already running my normal loop, plus some, and building towards the trail run.
