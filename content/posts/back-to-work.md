Back to work today.

Short post because I ran out of time today and have to get to sleep.

I haven't started running again just yet, but I walked fairly fast a day or so ago and my shins pain flared up again almost right after. I'm not sure what that means, but I am going to stick to walking for a little bit longer.

My tentative plan is to walk now. In the next few days I'll walk very briskly for a few minutes and then "cool down" again. In the next week or two I'll try to graduate that back to a light jog. This time sticking more to an "Interval" training sort of plan. First few days/week I will run for 1 minute, walk for 2 minutes. With the goal being to swap those 2 times after a few days or another week of following that. With it eventually ending in the full \~6km loop being lightly jogged. Then I'll reset and start over with 1 minute run and 2 minutes walk. Following the same process to turn it into a full 6km run. Once I hit that point I want to again work in a little extra distance, and start to work on increasing my running speed.

I've also been thinking of swimming, in the next few days I'll stop at the pool and check out their rates during one of my lunch hours.
