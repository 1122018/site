Yesterday I changed my life.

I made the decision to start being proactive in making my life better. I have said to myself many times in the past: "This is it" and "I'm really going to stick with it this time" far too many times. Every time I either didn't stick with it past day 1, or maybe stuck it out for a few months or even a year. Though, almost inevitably, I failed in my goals. I failed to eat better, I failed to exercise more, I failed to lose weight, I failed to focus on my work. I failed. A lot.

I'm done failing.

Yesterday morning my alarm went off at 4:35 AM. I forced myself out of bed and plopped myself down in front of the computer and started working. Nobody else was awake, outside was quiet, there was no TV in the background. Only me. Long story short: I actually got shit done.

Instead of my usual time wasting online, I was completely focused on maximizing my time alone. I didn't check emails, or browse reddit, or check out youtube. Just worked.

At 6:45 AM I grabbed my dog and went for a walk, something I regularly neglected to do in the past. I am not in shape, and so for now I'll walk, though I am aiming to turn it into a morning run. I walked from 6:45 AM until 7:45 AM, and covered quite a few kilometers. My dog was tired, I was tired, my legs ached by the end of it. But it felt amazing. And it wasn't even 8 AM yet.

I got home, showered, ate a light breakfast, and then walked to work. Walking to work isn't something I do very often, and after my long, fast-paced walk that morning, my legs were tired. Particularly the front of my shin (Tibialis anterior muscle, thanks google). My feet kept flopping down with every step, they felt heavy. 

 I got to work and eventually lunch time rolled around, and I was starving. Again instead of driving, I walked to go find some food. There was a new sushi place in town that had just opened recently, so I decided to head there. They had a specials menu, I ordered the chicken ramen off of it. It was pretty awesome.

All in all, I had a really productive day yesterday. I got a ton done in the morning, I got a lot done at work, I walked about 10km. I changed my life.

Today is Sunday, normally my day off. My alarm went off at 4:35 AM. 

And it will tomorrow too.
