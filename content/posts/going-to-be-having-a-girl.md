Found out today that we are going to be having a baby girl :)

Unfortunately we only had a boy name decided... haha. I'm sure we will figure out a perfect name for a girl as well though.

Today was just kind of hectic. Juggling work and learning this CMS so that I can re-deliver a client site by next week on it. Realistically I have until Monday, but I think I'll have to postpone it slightly. Just to make sure I get it right.

It was also my grandma's birthday today. Went over on my lunch break and had some pizza she made. Delicious, as always.

This is actually going to be a short post. We watched my little sister's guitar performance tonight, so it's way past my bedtime. I've seen a lot of these guitar school shows, and I think that this was the best one yet. Everyone sang really well. I don't think I can really pick out a performer who did poorly at all. Plus my sister really did well. Loved her parts.

Up early tomorrow for a full day of learning and getting my office painting finished.
