The fog this morning was pretty wild looking.

***

My new chair got here early today, and sat outside my front door for who knows how long. Glad nobody touched it, but I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that this chair that cost me a couple hundred bucks just sat clearly on my front step all day while I was at work. For whatever reason the delivery people here always just leave it outside, usually without even knocking.

I built the chair once I got home from work, and decided for the umpteenth time that building things that come in boxes is my least favorite activity ever. For whatever reason it is impossible to put together things like this without at least 1 little thing going completely wrong. One of the bolts just would not screw into the threading without jamming/stripping it. I spent probably 30 minutes alone on that one bolt before I just gave up trying to get it to go in perfectly straight and forced it. Hopefully that doesn't strip out any day soon.

I've done a few days of fasting 24 hours at a time now, and I've read and watched a few videos on time restricted eating/feeding. Starting tomorrow I am going to try and stick to a time-restricted diet for at least a few weeks and see how it affects me.

My goal is going to be to eat lunch around 1pm, dinner at 6pm, and that is it. I may work in a small snack a bit before 1pm, but I'll try without for the first bit and see how that goes.

I'm going to say 7:30pm is my cutoff time for eating. 

More on that later.
