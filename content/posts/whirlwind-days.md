Another upside down image... Ok.

I feel like my days are just shooting past without ever really having enough time to get anything substantial done. It's quite stressful and I can feel myself getting burnt out at work. 

My position in my daily work is very loose, and I am in more of a jack of all trades support role, rather than having a particular job title. Which often makes my workload hectic and overwhelming. Yet, I make an entry level wage. It's not fulfilling work, and it is really becoming a grind. The job is only temporary, and was started with the very clear intention that it was my 2nd priority (My own business being #1), and I would work full time temporarily to supplement my income and help the business through the holiday season. Over time it has become more and more demanding, to the point that I am now regularly having to make sacrifices in my own business to accommodate.

I try not to complain about work, because it is necessary, but I know that I will not be able to do this job much longer without it really negatively impacting me. I have so much I want to do and accomplish, but I have no time to do it.

Another point of stress is that I want to push myself to do more, but I cannot find the time to do it. I want to push myself to run harder in the mornings, but I am too overweight and my joints, very literally, cannot handle it. I have the energy and the will to do more. But I do not have the time or physical ability. It is a very trapped sort of feeling. At the very least, I am in control of my physical ability, and that is improving and changing over time. I have already lost over 10lbs since I started eating better and being active daily. I am looking forward to physical freedom, and it is a really good motivator in that respect.

I am also intensely motivated to not to have to rely on a job that pays not much more than minimum wage, and to be able to support myself and my family to live comfortably. I just hope that I can start to see some real progress soon.
