##### One Month

Before I started I was almost completely sedentary, with the exception of walking the dog and fishing occasionally. I weighed 224 lbs. I was not working on my own business as much as I should have been. I had a negative outlook on many things.

So far I have lost 18 lbs. I have managed to run my full 6 km loop without stopping. I have been conscious of my eating habits. I have gotten up at 4:35-4:45 AM every day. I have worked \~2 hours every morning before anyone else usually starts their day. I have overhauled my business. I have built my new office. Overall my attitude and outlook on life, work, and many things has improved drastically. I have started reading again as often as I can find time. 

I have a lot of plans for the future.

##### New Year's Resolution

I am not going to really have a traditional New Year's resolution. My only goal is something I have already started, and is an all-encompassing project. 

> Today I change my life.

That is it. In 2019, I will continue to change my life. I will work to improve every aspect of my life. I am done being lazy. Done being fat. Done depending on others. 2019 will be the first full year of my life that I am taking full control. By December 1st, 2019, I will do a full year in review, and be able to look back on how far I came. My 2020 New Year's resolution will be the same as this year, and so will every one after that.

##### Food and Stuff

Tonight we had a ton of appetizers and everyone ate way too much. But it was awesome and delicious. Tomorrow is New Year's lunch at my grandparents, and that will be the last of the holiday food and "parties".

Here is what we ate:
