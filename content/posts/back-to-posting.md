I'll have to figure out new tags/categories for these posts because I still won't be doing them daily.

After nearly a month of not posting, a number of things have happened.

I transitioned almost entirely to swimming every day rather than running. It has been going quite well, I am going to start putting running back into the routine in the next week. I'll be starting very lightly, about 15 minutes of running at a time. Likely stop and go within those 15 minutes, just short loops. I am focusing much more on landing forefoot currently, to try and strengthen my arch to be able to do long distance runs naturally.

I have also been intermittently going to the gym, I will be making this part of my regular schedule during this next week as well. I saw some very quick progress when I started going regularly, I'd like to build on that.

I have also been keeping on the Keto diet successfully. I do plan to stop strict Keto within the next few weeks though. I have lost now nearly 50 lbs from my original weight at the start of December. I have a bit more to go to hit my goal weight, but I'd like to put a focus on building muscle and have a bit more freedom in my eating. I am planning to transition to Paleo-ish. I will not be reintroducing breads, pastas, or grains to my diet in any major way. I will eat them if we are at some kind of special family event, but otherwise they will still be eliminated. The biggest thing is that I want to be able to reintroduce all vegetables and fruits into my diet. The hardest thing with Keto is keeping my electrolytes up. I am taking supplements, but it is still quite difficult. I also plan to do Keto again once my wife gives birth and she is on it to get back in shape as well. After that I will do Keto once every month or so for about a week.

I have also been strict on an intermittent fasting schedule and have no plans to stop this.

On work: I have started now to primarily work from my home office again. This is going to allow me a lot more freedom to be able to do client outreach as well as focusing on generating sales and building my business. I have a long contract of sorts for the next few months that is justifying working from home nearly full time. There should be some big improvements in my business soon due to this.
