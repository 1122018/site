Boom. Daylight.

My morning routine was a little different today. Turns out my shin hurts a bit more than I initially thought. I’ll take it a bit easier over the holidays. 

May wife joined me on my walk this morning. I forgot to take a pic then because we were chatting, but I took another walk later because of the shorter walk this morning. 

Not much to say today. And there won’t be much tomorrow either. 

Had dinner at my grandparents as usual. It was really nice.

Merry Christmas.
