Got my new shoes today. They came a lot earlier than expected. So much earlier that I rushed out of the shower in a towel to answer the door in time. 

Day 1 barefoot shoe review:

Feels cold. 

Walking hurts. 

Forces you to realize how much you relied on your heel to walk. 

Little pebbles suck.

The end.

I'll update again tomorrow after I try going for a run with these. I'm expecting it to be a short run, not sure about these shoes yet. They did have a 100 day money back guarantee. So I'm going to give them a real try before I really nail down any criticisms. 

That said: They are 100% less comfortable than most other shoes I've touched. But I don't think that's the goal anyways. On the other hand, at the end of a full day wearing them, I wasn't looking forward to getting them off or feeling any relief when I took them off. So I think I'd count that as a plus overall.

I failed to get up on time the last couple mornings. This morning was close but still after 5AM. Back on track tomorrow.
