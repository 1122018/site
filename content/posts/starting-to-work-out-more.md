I have upped my step goal of to 12,000 steps in a day. And it has already caught me slacking. I often get 14k+ without really trying to, but there are also quite a few days where I’ve barely broken 10k. So all I’m trying to do is up that barely broken by a couple thousand steps. In the future I will up this by 500 at a time.

I have also started to notice the weight loss in my arms and legs particularly. What I noticed in particular is that they are already fairly slim and small while I still have a bit of a gut. 

I have already been doing push-ups and a few other routines mixed in here or there but I want to put more focus on my legs and just generally a more rounded work out. 

There are a few gyms in town so my plan is to try them all out before picking one. I want 24/7 access because I plan to change up my morning routine a bit to accommodate a real workout.
