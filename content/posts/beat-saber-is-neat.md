This picture was particular cool looking. Orange ground, blue sky. Could probably touch it up to look really nice.

Very average day. Stuck to the schedule, got my computer equipment permanently moved to my new office now. Internet getting moved next week. Will just have to suffer with wifi for now. The next thing is figuring out how Iâ€™m going to keep the couches out of the way until we can get rid of them. Also I need to look at getting some kind of stool or tall chair for the desk. 

I am trying not to spend any more money on the office, but my current chairs are just too short, so I may have to make an exception on that.

I am going to try and get out fishing for a day or two before Christmas time off is over. I am feeling a bit too stressed lately.
