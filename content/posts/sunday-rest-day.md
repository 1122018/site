No photo outside today. Was out for a few walks but was distracted each time and just forgot to snap any pics.

Starting today, I am going to set aside Sunday as a rest day. I am still going to stick to my normal sleep and wake times, but unless there is some immediate pressing matter: no work.

It is not as though I’ve been working as hard as I can every Sunday and don’t want to do that anymore, I am more just trying to organize and morph this routine to fit into my life a bit better now that I am comfortable with it.

I have a lot of stress in my life. The vast majority of it is work related, but there is also finding time to get things done at home, a baby on the way in 3 months, health issues, and a multitude of other minor things that all add up to one big ball of stress. I have started adding meditation into my daily routine, and plan to stick with it, though I think it will still be a while before I’m well practiced enough for it to make a significant impact on my stress levels. 

So planning ahead for Sunday to be a complete rest day from work, as well as part of my daily exercise, will hopefully help in reducing some stress overall. 

I will still be going for a run, or more likely walk, on sundays. But I may head out a little later and spend my early morning on some reading or gaming or whatever else I’m into that day. And beyond that, I want to try to spend time with more family every Sunday. Lastly, I will be setting one small goal for house work to be done each Sunday. 

All that said, I’m mostly just going to play it by ear and see how the next few sundays go and just roll with it.
