Today I finished painting my new office. It turned out better than I thought it would. I added my accent colors today and they look pretty sharp. I'll post some pictures once it is 100% complete. 

I have a lot more work to do on this new software before Tuesday, but I may just take some time tomorrow to at least get started on building the desk and finding some cheap flooring/carpeting. The faster I get the office done, the faster I can move my current set up down there and start getting into the rhythm of "going to work". Right now my office is right in the middle of our day to day area, and I know my productivity suffers because of it.

In addition to being more productive. It will free up my current office as a space to make our new guest room, and then turning our current guest room into the baby's room. Lots to do in the next few months before the baby shows up. We are planning on making a mural wall in the baby's room. Some kind of simple mountain scene. Not totally sure yet on how we will do it, other than having the color scheme being a nice green and the grey that is already on some of the walls in that room.

We had dinner at my dad's place tonight, he did roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, and had some bread. The chicken was awesome, he put a bit of this crazy spicy chili paste on the skin before roasting and it came out extra delicious.

I forgot we were going and had bought supplies for dinner tonight, so that will be tomorrow. I'll post some pictures of it as well. Going to be trying to make a vegan dish. At least I think it's vegan. Looks tasty anyways.

On a side note, I ordered a free laser pointer off of Wish some time around 8 or 9 months ago. Completely forgot about it, but it showed up in my mail box the other day! Free laser pointers are way better than normal ones.
