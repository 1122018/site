Today I ate lunch at 1pm, got home and cooked/ate dinner by 7pm, with a bit of munching while putting it all away in the fridge. All in all, about a 6.5 - 7 hour window for eating today. I was fairly hungry around 10am this morning, but that feeling passed quite quickly and I did not feel starving at lunch time. 

I didn't expect it to be hard at all to eat within this schedule, but it should not pose any problems going forward with this.

No pictures, but I made a Vegan/Keto dinner tonight. Vegetable stir fry with a teriyaki-ish sauce over cauliflower rice. 

It was surprisingly good. I've never tried cauliflower rice before, but I will make it again in the future.

Part of changing my eating is also going to include cutting out as much carbs and meat as possible. I still want to eat eggs, and fish, but other than that, I feel that meat will be a very rare occasion, red meat even less frequently. I don't necessarily want to become vegetarian or vegan, but I do see the benefit of eating that way. Changing my schedule and cutting carbs is my first step. I've got chicken in the freezer that I won't waste, so that will get eaten before I truly cut meat out for a while. I also don't want to do too many restrictions all at once. Not that I feel demotivated to do this, but with too many changes at once I can see myself longing to have the things I cut a lot more.

I've not gotten a huge amount of work done on my business since the holidays, starting tomorrow morning I am going to work to change that. I have a 7 hour shift tomorrow, so I will use the extra hour, plus some time in the evening (as well as the normal morning hours) to pump out as much as I can. The same for my next 2 days off from work.
