I've taken things a little easier lately due to some medical concerns, although still walking every day and following my work schedule.

Started going to bed a little earlier to get just a bit more sleep, I don't think I have been getting enough.

I had some concerns with my heart, so I've seen a doctor a few times this month. They found some abnormality recently. Which was fairly shocking thing when it's concerning my heart I would think.

More on that later.
