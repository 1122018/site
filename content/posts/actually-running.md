Today I ran 90% of my loop. Well, more like "ran". At times my running speed was no more than my normal walking speed, maybe even less. I set out with the goal to just keep moving the entire time. I stopped and walked while the dog was doing her business again and then after that I just pushed through the rest of the way. I also stopped once more to walk for about a minute or two, at the top of a few long hills I pushed my way through.

I may have pushed myself a bit too hard today, for a guy my size anyways. My heart rate went a bit too high during 1 push up a big hill, and my knees may be paying for it tomorrow, so I'll take it easy for a few days at least. But I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. And I did. My loop is just under 6km. I have never managed to run that far all at once in the past 10 years probably. So it is a fairly big achievement I think. It looks like it's going to be raining hard all night and probably tomorrow morning as well, so I'll probably just walk next time.

I started wearing the fitbit today and got 10,372 steps in by the time I am writing this post. I don't know how accurate the readings are, but it seems high in some regards:

10,372 steps. 50 floors. 8.78 km. 3,429 cals. 94 minutes of active time. My resting BPM is 69. I think most of that seems accurate, except probably the calories. That seems really high for just running at a fairly slow pace.

I decided again today that I wasn't happy with my new website design, and started making some big modifications again. I don't feel that it is suitable for someone who claims to be a web designer to not put 110% into my own design. I have always been lazy with my own work and websites, so I am changing that now. I've put a solid few full work days worth of time now into revamping my design. It's getting close, not quite there yet though. Maybe one day I'll share some more specifics about myself and my work on here.

Not much else to report today. For the rest of the day I took it pretty easy. Spent a lot of time with my family. Had some homemade biscuits at my dad's house this morning with my step mom and sister. My uncle and aunt were also over.

Went for dinner at one of my grandparents, and just relaxed for a few hours around that. 

Played a fair bit of smash today with my little sister and got my ass handed to me more than a few times. 

Pretty good day all said and done. :)
