50 days of doing this so far. Not going to lie, finding the motivation to sit down and write a silly post like this is harder and harder. I don't particularly love writing blog posts, but I set myself a goal. If I break this part of it, my very first "promise", I'm sure the rest of it will unravel shortly after.

50 days, almost 30 lbs down, feeling better mentally, work is getting in order slowly, baby is slow cooking away. Things are going fairly well right now. I don't have a ton to talk about though. Planning on getting some work done on the house this weekend, getting closer to being able to start the baby's room.

My wife made a keto lasagna tonight, it was super good. Didn't take any pics, but it didn't look any different than normal lasagna anyways!

I have planned a bit of an "extra-curricular" activity to do with the wim hof method, more on that tomorrow.
