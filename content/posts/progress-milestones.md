##### Activity

When I first started all of this it was a conscious effort to achieve 10,000+ steps every day. I was making time to do more movement throughout the day. Comparing to these days, I do not really consciously _choose_ to do any activity that gets me over that step threshold. Everything that I've worked towards starting has become normal for me now. It is a given that I go for a walk or run every morning. It is a given that I walk to work, often home as well.

I will update my step goal to be 12,000 from now on.

##### Food

I do not think that I have truly gotten into ketosis yet, though I've made a large effort in changing my eating habits. I have adopted a mostly "keto-ish" and "vegan-conscious" diet. I have not cut out meat by any means, but I am often exploring vegan options and including many more vegetarian/vegan dishes into my daily meals. 

As for the keto, I am trying to eventually achieve ketosis and to maintain it at least as long as the rest of my weight loss takes. Though, in the meantime, I have cut out carbs for the most part. I do not eat bread/pasta/added sugar or high carb fruits/veg/other foods. 

I do not plan to stick to this way of eating forever. Once I've achieved my goal weight or have started putting a more serious focus on building muscle, I want to incorporate carbs back into my diet. That said, I will not reincorporate bread, pasta or added sugars. So I will eat things like potatoes, and carb heavy fruits without worrying about my daily carb intake on those items.

##### Weight

Today I hit a weight milestone. I have hit this milestone multiple times in the past, but this time it is different. It is different because I was truly motivated this time. It is different because I have more motivation now than when I started. It even feels different than the previous times I lost weight. When I started this on December 1st, 2018 I was 225-228 lbs. I don't know the exact weight as I wasn't actively weighing myself or tracking any weights at the time. But it was at least 225 lbs. For my height, that put me _well_ into the category of being obese. 

As of today I have hit a weight that according to online BMI calculators (which I know are not necessarily accurate or to be relied upon for any individual body type) that puts me just under the threshold for being categorized as just overweight, rather than obese.

It has also coincided with me hitting a large number milestone: breaking 200lbs. I fully expect that number to jump back up to 200+ for a short time as my weight fluctuates fairly frequently on the way down, but this is the first time in years I haven't seen my weight starting with a 2.
