Today was a very average feeling sort of day.

I didn't mention it yesterday but I did head out fishing for a little bit, I didn't get any bites or fish so it wasn't much worth mentioning. Last night though, the trail I was walking on to one of my fishing spots gave way after a storm wind pulled a few trees off the cliff. I remember seeing the trail starting to slip down the cliff and thinking that has to go soon. I even gave a hearty step onto it to see how solid it was. I suppose not very.

This is the "Rushbrook Trail" that was fairly recently completed. Really nicely done trail, right in the middle of town basically. This part of the trail was slipping for at least the past week, from when I and other regular trail walkers noticed it. Though looking at the image it doesn't look like it was sitting on very stable ground to begin with.

I almost got hit by 2 cars in the dark on my walk this morning. I was already thinking I should, but that prompted me to order two wearing led lights, one for myself and one for the dog. In the meantime I'll be sure to wear some clothing with reflective strips on it.  This town has notoriously bad street lighting.

I spent the morning doing a clients website, and following up on a few emails. I was running a bit late today, because I started my walk late, so I rushed out a few scrambled eggs in a lunch box for my wife and I and raced to work.

Work was more or less uneventful.

I had a meeting over lunch and secured a new client. I think this will be an important client for me. They have a long-standing, prominent business in town and are active in the business community, as well as with city officials. I'll be putting my all into making sure their end result is the best that I have the ability to create.

I got my wife started again on doing evening walks with the dog. Hopefully can keep that up with her until shes close to having the baby.

An average day, but still a positive one.
