I seem to keep catching myself looking for excuses not to do this, or not to do that. I still do them, because I'm pushing myself to do this. To be consistent. But the thoughts are quite pervasive. 

I started writing these posts at night, because I wanted more time in the morning to focus on work. All that's really happened is that I keep going to sleep and forgetting that I didn't write my post yet. So I either get back up and write it, or I never remembered about it and it's not until the next morning (like today), that I realize I forgot and write it the following the morning. I am going to change that routine today. My new post writing time is going to be between 6pm and 7pm. This is usually when I'm making dinner, and I'll try to get it done while I'm cooking or immediately after eating.

I also started leaving for my walk/run a little later in the morning, 7am roughly. I still am up at the same time, and my reason for going later was that I felt like I was in the middle of work and just needed that extra 15 minutes. Since starting that I've used my morning time less efficiently. I watch a few youtube videos sometimes, or keep catching myself starting to browse random internet things. Also starting today I'm going back to 6:45 am, get outside. Having the extra \~15 minutes after my walk or run is done really helps me to not feel like I'm racing to get out the door in time for work. I made and ate my last breakfast in record time. I don't think I actually even tasted it.

Long story short, I'm looking for excuses and getting lazy. It's almost 2 weeks in and I need to get back into a more stable schedule. At least for my mornings.

All that said, it's not like I got nothing done today. In the morning I spent a bit of time learning some new frameworks that I'm going to be using in my day to day once I'm comfortable. 

After resting with walking/brisk walking for 2 days after running, I decided to give the run a try again. I ran the majority of the loop, but gave myself a little extra walking time at the top of a big hill and towards the end before home. 

I walked home from work during lunch, got caught in a rainstorm on the way back and my wife had to drop off some dry pants and underwear for me. I was soaked. I walked home from work at the end of the day as well. I think that I'll just start walking to and from whenever it's possible. Hopefully daily.  

By the end of the day, I had over 14k steps on the fitbit. Though I think this thing is a little gratuitous in it's step counting. Often just lifting my arm while sitting will log a step or two. Still, I was getting between 8k and 10k steps on my workdays the previous week. so hitting over 14k felt good. I want to try and increase that. Once I have my new office finished and starting working more often there, I should be able to be a little more active during the day. I'm planning on building my desk at a height that I can comfortable stand, or sit on a high chair at. Either that or building a block that I can put my keyboard/monitors on to be standing height when I need a break from sitting.

At work I got a ton of jobs done out of my list and co-worker's lists. So that felt good and productive. The work day went by fast.

With the exception of catching myself looking for excuses to get lazy, it was a good day, and it felt productive.
