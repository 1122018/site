Back to the normal morning schedule. Going to start heading to sleep a little earlier, my sleep times are pretty weak and I’m waking up in the middle of the night a few times it seems like (according the to Fitbit, I don’t remember waking). So I’ll just try to get a bit more sleep for a few days and see how it affects me.

Our car died today, so I went and got ripped off buying a new battery. Though, this is hopefully the last purchase for this car before we get a new one next year.

We also started looking at some baby stuff online and realized strollers are ridiculously expensive. Never expected them to cost upwards of $1000 for higher end ones.

Not much else to say today, fairly uneventful day. Back tomorrow.
